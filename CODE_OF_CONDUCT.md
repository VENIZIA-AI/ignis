- **Be kind and courteous.** Treat everyone with respect and consideration.
- **Be collaborative.** Work together constructively and help others learn.
- **Be patient.** Remember that everyone was a beginner once.
- **Accept constructive criticism gracefully.** We all make mistakes and can learn from them.
