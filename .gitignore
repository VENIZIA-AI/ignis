# --- Best Practices .gitignore for Node.js/TypeScript Projects ---

# Dependency directories
# Keep these out of version control to avoid bloating the repository.
# They should be installed by package managers on each machine.
node_modules/
jspm_packages/
bower_components/
.pnpm-store/

# Lock files for other package managers
# This project uses bun, so other lockfiles can be ignored.
package-lock.json
yarn.lock
bun.lockb

# Build and Compilation Output
# These files are generated from source code and don't need to be in version control.

*.tsbuildinfo
.lock-wscript

# Documentation (VitePress)
# Ignore the cache and build output from the documentation generator.
